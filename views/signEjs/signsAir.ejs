          <h2>Air</h2>
          <p>
            According to the astrologer Leonardo Lemos, "the Air element shows
            us that life requires flexibility to establish exchanges with the
            environment in which we are inserted." He also adds that, in this
            sense, the mind and reasoning are fundamental.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intelligent by nature, Air has a very strong focus on ideas and
            ideals. However, according to Leonardo, the absence of this element
            in the Natal Chart can harm socialization, lightness, and
            communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the Natal Chart, many other factors work together
            with the elements. That's why you can find people of the same
            element with different characteristics. It is always essential to
            observe the whole. That's what we will see next.

          <h3>Gemini</h3>
          <p>
            Individuals born under the sign of Gemini typically possess
            characteristics such as curiosity, intelligence, and a desire for
            freedom. They are always seeking challenges, learning, and
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geminis have a versatile personality and adapt easily, which is
            great. However, without maturity, these traits can easily lead to
            insincerity, which is not so good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mercury is the ruling planet of Gemini, which relates the sign to
            creativity and communication.
          </p>

        <div id="signs">
          <h3>Libra</h3>
          <p>
            Librans, in general, identify with traits like courtesy, delicacy,
            and a quest for balance. It's common for these individuals to be
            empathetic and diplomatic in their relationships and have a talent
            for mediating conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Libra also has an affinity for the beautiful, which is why they are
            natural lovers of the arts in general. However, it's essential to
            maintain balance; this trait can lead Libra individuals to excessive
            vanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not surprisingly, Venus is the ruling planet of Libra. Hence, the
            planet emphasizes the idealization of perfect love.
          </p>

          <h3>Aquarius</h3>
          <p>
            Individuals with the Sun in Aquarius tend to be innovative and
            independent. At the same time, they have a strong sense of
            collectivity, believing that individual well-being only occurs when
            there is collective well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aquarians have a questioning and, at times, radical personality. In
            case of immaturity, all these characteristics together can result in
            an extremist attitude, or what we know as "rebel without a cause."
          </p>
          <p>
            The sign of Aquarius has two ruling planets, Saturn and Uranus. The
            former emphasizes the importance of closing cycles to allow new ones
            to begin. The latter highlights the appreciation of renewal.
