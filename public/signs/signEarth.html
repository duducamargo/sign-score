                <h2>Earth</h2>
                <p>
                    If we could summarize the Earth element in one word, perhaps the most appropriate one would be
                    practicality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Earth defines the action of the stars with practicality and pragmatism. Planets act according to
                    materiality and reality, recognizing their own limits and gradually advancing toward their goals.
                    The tone is the pursuit of security and stability," says astrologer Leonardo Lemos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, according to Leonardo, when a chart does not show the Earth element, "there is a
                    difficulty in dealing with limits, concretizing and giving shape to their efforts." In this case,
                    the person stays too much in the world of ideas and too little in the world of applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, although there are common characteristics among people of the Earth element in general, it
                    manifests with some peculiarities depending on the sign. This is because reading the Natal Chart
                    cannot be done by looking at just one piece of information. You have to see the whole picture.

                <h3>Taurus</h3>
                <p>
                    The sign of Taurus symbolizes the steadfastness of Earth. Taureans tend to be calm and persistent,
                    with a great appreciation for their possessions and material goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, excessive "steadfastness" can result in stubbornness. Or, even difficulty
                    accepting change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Venus is the ruling planet of Taurus, relating the sign to loving in a caring and affectionate way.
                    Being in the company of Taureans reveals someone who loves in a practical and gentle manner.
                </p>

            <div id="signs">
                <h3>Virgo</h3>
                <p>
                    Individuals born under the sign of Virgo tend to be objective and organized. Attentive to details,
                    they are often somewhat perfectionistic â€“ which can be either good or bad, depending on how this
                    characteristic affects their daily life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virgos are loyal to the people they love, whether they are family, friends, or a partner. Sincere
                    and mature, they usually have no trouble expressing their feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virgo is ruled by Mercury, which highlights its critical and opinionated nature.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="signs">
                <h3>Capricorn</h3>
                <p>
                    Capricorn individuals possess strong Earth element characteristics, with well-defined goals and an
                    understanding of their limits. For them, success comes through persistence, learning, and
                    discipline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if they don't know how to control their excessive material focus, they may develop
                    attitudes like greed and pessimism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Saturn as its ruling planet, the sign of Capricorn naturally understands that everything has
                    its time.
